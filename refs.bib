  abstract             = {{This book continues the treatment of the arithmetic theory of elliptic curves begun in the first volume. The book begins with the theory of elliptic and modular functions for the full modular group r(1), including a discussion of Hekcke operators and the L-series associated to cusp forms. This is followed by a detailed study of elliptic curves with complex multiplication, their associated Gr\"{o}ssencharacters and L-series, and applications to the construction of abelian extensions of quadratic imaginary fields. Next comes a treatment of elliptic curves over function fields and elliptic surfaces, including specialization theorems for heights and sections. This material serves as a prelude to the theory of minimal models and N\'{e}ron models of elliptic curves, with a discussion of special fibers, conductors, and Ogg's formula. Next comes a brief description of q-models for elliptic curves over C and R, followed by Tate's theory of q-models for elliptic curves with non-integral j-invariant over p-adic fields. The book concludes with the construction of canonical local height functions on elliptic curves, including explicit formulas for both archimedean and non-archimedean fields.}},

  abstract  = {The braid groups are infinite non-commutative groups
                   naturally arising from geometric braids. The aim of
                   this article is twofold. One is to show that the
                   braid groups can serve as a good source to enrich
                   cryptography. The feature that makes the braid groups
                   useful to cryptography includes the followings: (i)
                   The word problem is solved via a fast algorithm which
                   computes the canonical form which can be efficiently
                   manipulated by computers. (ii) The group operations
                   can be performed efficiently. (iii) The braid groups
                   have many mathematically hard problems that can be
                   utilized to design cryptographic primitives. The
                   other is to propose and implement a new key agreement
                   scheme and public key cryptosystem based on these
                   primitives in the braid groups. The efficiency of our
                   systems is demonstrated by their speed and
                   information rate. The security of our systems is
                   based on topological, combinatorial and
                   group-theoretical problems that are intractible
                   according to our current mathematical knowledge. The
                   foundation of our systems is quite different from
                   widely used cryptosystems based on number theory, but
                   there are some similarities in design.},

                   in several draft standards. DHIES is a Diffie-Hellman
                   based scheme that combines a symmetric encryption
                   method, a message authentication code, and a hash

                   in a way which is intended to provide security
                   against chosen-ciphertext attacks. In this paper we
                   find natural assumptions under which DHIES achieves
                   security under chosen-ciphertext attack. The
                   assumptions we make about the Diffie-Hellman problem
                   are interesting variants of the customary ones, and

                   model; no random-oracle assumption is required.},

  title    = {Number Theoretic Algorithms for Elliptic Curves},
  school   = {University of Maryland},
  year     = {2008},
  abstract = {We present new algorithms related to both theoretical
                   and practical questions in the area of elliptic
                   curves and class field theory. The dissertation has
                   two main parts, as described below. Let O be an
                   imaginary quadratic order of discriminant D < 0, and
                   let K = √ Q( D). The class polynomial HD of O is
                   the polynomial whose roots are precisely the
                   j-invariants of elliptic curves with complex
                   multiplication by O. Computing this polynomial is
                   useful in constructing elliptic curves suitable for
                   cryptography, as well as in the context of explicit
                   class field theory. In the first part of the
                   dissertation, we present an algorithm to compute HD
                   p-adically where p is a prime inert in K and not
                   dividing D. ̃ This involves computing the canonical
                   lift E of a pair (E, f ) where E is a supersingular
                   elliptic curve and f is an embedding of O into the
                   endomorphism ring of E. We also present an algorithm
                   to compute HD modulo p for p inert which is used in
                   the Chinese remainder theorem algorithm to compute HD
                   . For an elliptic curve E over any field K, the Weil
                   pairing en is a bilinear map on the points of order n
                   of E. The Weil pairing is a useful tool in both the
                   theory of elliptic curves and the application of
                   elliptic curves to cryptography. However, for K of
                   characteristic p, the classical Weil pairing on the
                   points of order p is trivial. In the second part of
                   the dissertation, we consider E over the dual numbers
                   K[ ] and define a non-degenerate ” Weil pairing on
                   p-torsion.” We show that this pairing satisfies
                   many of the same properties of the classical pairing.
                   Moreover, we show that it directly relates to recent
                   attacks on the discrete logarithm problem on the
                   p-torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the
                   finite field Fq . We also present a new attack on the
                   discrete logarithm problem on anomalous curves using
                   a lift of E over Fp [ ].},

                   polynomial system can be reduced to linear algebra
                   operations in the quotient algebra A= k[ X 1,…, X
                   n]/I, where I is the ideal generated by the input
                   system. Assuming that the multiplicative structure of
                   the algebra A is (partly) known, we address the
                   question of speeding up the linear algebra phase for
                   the computation of minimal polynomials and rational
                   parametrizations in A. We present new formul{\ae} for
                   the rational parametrizations, extending those of
                   Rouillier, and algorithms extending ideas introduced

                   based on the A-module structure of the dual space

                   n2 nD 5/2) respectively, where D is the dimension of
                   A. For fixed n, this is better than algorithms based

                   let GF[q,x] denote the integral domain of polynomials
                   in an indeterminate x over GF(q). Further, let Γ =
                   Γ(q) denote the algebraic closure of GF(q) so that
                   every polynomial in GF[q,x] on which there is defined
                   a binary considers certain sets of monic polynomials
                   from GF[q,x] on which there is defined a binary
                   operation called the composed product. Here, if f and
                   g are monics in GF[q,x] with deg f = m and deg g=n,
                   then the composed product, denoted by f♦g and
                   defined in terms of the roots of f and g, is also in
                   GF[q,x] and has degree mn. In the present paper, the
                   two most important composed products, denoted by the
                   special symbols Ō and ∗, are those induced by the
                   field multiplication and the field addition on Γ and
                   defined by: f∘g = Π Παβ (x − αβ), f∗g =
                   Π Παβ (x − (α+β)), where the products
                   indicated by П are the usual products in Γ[x] and
                   are taken over all the roots α of f and β of g,
                   (including multiplicities). These two composed
                   products are called composed multiplication and
                   composed addition, respectively. After introducing
                   and developing some theory concerning a more general
                   notion of composed product, this paper moves to the
                   special composed products above and asks whether the
                   irreducibles over GF(q) can be factored uniquely into
                   indecomposables with respect to each of these
                   products. Here, the term “irreducible” is used in
                   the usual sense of the word while the term
                   “indecomposable” is used in reference to composed
                   products. This question is shown to have an
                   affirmative answer in both situations, and thus yield
                   unique factorization theorems (multiplicative and
                   additive) for Γ. These theorems are then used to
                   prove corresponding unique factorization theorems for
                   all subfields of Γ. Next, it is shown that there are
                   no irreducibles f in GF[q,x] which can be decomposed
                   as f=f1Ōg1=f2∗g2 (except for trivial
                   decompositions). A special inversion formula is then
                   derived and using this inversion formula, the authors
                   determine the numbers of irreducibles of degree n
                   which are indecomposable with respect to (i) composed
                   multiplication Ō, (ii) composed addition ∗, and
                   (iii) both the composed products Ō and ∗
                   simultaneously. These numbers are given in terms of
                   the well-known number of irreducibles of degree n
                   over GF(q). A final section contains some discussion
                   and several observations about the more general
                   composed product.},

                   ℓ . Graphs of isogenies of degree a power of
                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}ell {\$}{\$} ℓ are
                   well-understood for elliptic curves, but not for
                   higher-dimensional abelian varieties. We study the
                   case of absolutely simple ordinary abelian varieties
                   over a finite field. We analyse graphs of so-called
                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathfrak l{\$}{\$} l -isogenies,
                   resolving that, in arbitrary dimension, their
                   structure is similar, but not identical, to the
                   ``volcanoes'' occurring as graphs of isogenies of
                   elliptic curves. Specializing to the case of
                   principally polarizable abelian surfaces, we then
                   exploit this structure to describe graphs of a
                   particular class of isogenies known as
                   {\$}{\$}({\backslash}ell , {\backslash}ell ){\$}{\$}
                   ( ℓ , ℓ ) -isogenies: those whose kernels are
                   maximal isotropic subgroups of the
                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}ell {\$}{\$} ℓ -torsion for the
                   Weil pairing. We use these two results to write an
                   algorithm giving a path of computable isogenies from
                   an arbitrary absolutely simple ordinary abelian
                   surface towards one with maximal endomorphism ring,
                   which has immediate consequences for the CM-method in
                   genus 2, for computing explicit isogenies, and for
                   the random self-reducibility of the discrete
                   logarithm problem in genus 2 cryptography.},

                   text is also an ideal reference book for the

                   contents into 21 more or less independent chapters
                   enables readers to familiarize themselves quickly

                   dealing with polynomial equations, coupled with their
                   implementation on fast inexpensive computers, has
                   sparked a minor revolution in the study and practice
                   of algebraic geometry. These algorithmic methods have
                   also given rise to some exciting new applications of
                   algebraic geometry. This book illustrates the many
                   uses of algebraic geometry, highlighting some of the
                   more recent applications of Gr\"{o}bner bases and
                   resultants. In order to do this, the authors provide
                   an introduction to some algebraic objects and
                   techniques which are more advanced than one typically
                   encounters in a first course, but nonetheless of
                   great utility. The book is written for nonspecialists
                   and for readers with a diverse range of backgrounds.
                   It assumes knowledge of the material covered in a
                   standard undergraduate course in abstract algebra,
                   and it would help to have some previous exposure to
                   Gr\"{o}bner bases. The book does not assume the
                   reader is familiar with more advanced concepts such
                   as modules. For this new edition the authors added
                   two new sections and a new chapter, updated the

                   two given elliptic curves over , originally motivated
                   by point counting, has recently awaken new interest
                   in the cryptology community thanks to the works of
                   Teske and Rostovtsev \& Stolbunov. While the large
                   characteristic case is well understood, only
                   suboptimal algorithms are known in small
                   characteristic; they are due to Couveignes, Lercier,
                   Lercier \& Joux and Lercier \& Sirvent. In this paper
                   we discuss the differences between them and run some
                   comparative experiments. We also present the first
                   complete implementation of Couveignes' second
                   algorithm and present improvements that make it the
                   algorithm having the best asymptotic complexity in
                   the degree of the isogeny.},

                   extension {M/K} . If this extension is Galois with a
                   solvable automorphism group, then the equation {f(X})
                   = 0 can be solved by radicals. The first step of the
                   solution consists of splitting the extension {M/K}
                   into intermediate fields. Such computations are
                   classical, and we explain how fast polynomial
                   arithmetic can be used to speed up the process.
                   Moreover, we extend the algorithms to a more general
                   case of extensions that are no longer Galois.

                   knowledge. This leads to the definition of
                   unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge
                   in which the prover demonstrates possession of
                   knowledge without revealing any computational
                   information whatsoever (not even the one bit revealed
                   in zero-knowledge proofs of assertions). We show the
                   relevance of these notions to identification schemes,
                   in which parties prove their identity by
                   demonstrating their knowledge rather than by proving
                   the validity of assertions. We describe a novel
                   scheme which is provably secure if factoring is
                   difficult and whose practical implementations are
                   about two orders of magnitude faster than RSA-based
                   identification schemes. The advantages of thinking in
                   terms of proofs of knowledge rather than proofs of
                   assertions are demonstrated in two efficient variants
                   of the scheme: unrestricted input zero-knowledge
                   proofs of knowledge are used in the construction of a
                   scheme which needs no directory; a version of the
                   scheme based on parallel interactive proofs (which
                   are not known to be zero knowledge) is proved secure
                   by observing that the identification protocols are
                   proofs of knowledge.},

                   elliptic curve, given the cardinality of the curve.
                   Using his work, we give a complete description of the
                   structure of curves related via rational ℓ-degree
                   isogenies, a structure we call a volcano. We explain
                   how we can travel through this structure using
                   modular polynomials. The computation of the structure
                   is possible without knowing the cardinality of the
                   curve, and that as a result, we deduce information on
                   the cardinality.},

  abstract  = {Given a system of polynomial equations and
                   inequations with coefficients in the field of
                   rational numbers, we show how to compute a geometric
                   resolution of the set of common roots of the system
                   over the field of complex numbers. A geometric
                   resolution consists of a primitive element of the
                   algebraic extension defined by the set of roots, its
                   minimal polynomial, and the parametrizations of the
                   coordinates. Such a representation of the solutions
                   has a long history which goes back to Leopold
                   Kronecker and has been revisited many times in
                   computer algebra. We introduce a new generation of
                   probabilistic algorithms where all the computations
                   use only univariate or bivariate polynomials. We give
                   a new codification of the set of solutions of a
                   positive dimensional algebraic variety relying on a
                   new global version of Newton's iterator. Roughly
                   speaking the complexity of our algorithm is
                   polynomial in some kind of degree of the system, in
                   its height, and linear in the complexity of
                   evaluation of the system. We present our
                   implementation in the Magma system which is called
                   Kronecker in homage to his method for solving systems
                   of polynomial equations. We show that the theoretical
                   complexity of our algorithm is well reflected in
                   practice and we exhibit some cases for which our
                   program is more efficient than the other available
                   software.},

                   have had several recent applications. An isogeny
                   volcano is a connected component of a larger graph
                   called a cordillera. In this paper, we further

                   that we have already computed one of a different
                   degree. This allows us to compute volcanoes of
                   composite degree more efficiently than a direct
                   construction using modular polynomials.},

  abstract  = {We give a generalization to Abelian varieties over
                   finite fields of the algorithm of Schoof for elliptic
                   curves. Schoof showed that for an elliptic curve
                   \$E\$ over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$, given by a Weierstrass
                   equation, one can compute the number of
                   \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$-rational points of \$E\$ in time
                   \$O((\log q)^9)\$. Our result is the following. Let
                   \$A\$ be an Abelian variety over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$.
                   Then one can compute the characteristic polynomial of
                   the Frobenius endomorphism of \$A\$ in time \$O((\log
                   q)^\Delta)\$, where \$\Delta\$ and the implied
                   constant depend only on the dimension of the
                   embedding space of \$A\$, the number of equations
                   defining \$A\$ and the addition law, and their
                   degrees. The method, generalizing that of Schoof, is
                   to use the machinery developed by Weil to prove the
                   Riemann hypothesis for Abelian varieties. By means of
                   this theory, the calculation is reduced to
                   ideal-theoretic computations in a ring of polynomials
                   in several variables over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$. As
                   applications we show how to count the rational points
                   on the reductions modulo primes \$p\$ of a fixed
                   curve over \$\mathbf {Q}\$ in time polynomial in
                   \$\log p\$; we show also that, for a fixed prime
                   \$l\$, we can compute the \$l\$th roots of unity
                   \$\operatorname{mod} p\$, when they exist, in
                   polynomial time in \$\log p\$. This generalizes
                   Schoof's application of his algorithm to find square
                   roots of a fixed integer \$x \operatorname{mod} p\$.},

  abstract  = {Identification is a useful cryptographic tool. Since
                   zero-know- ledge theory appeared [ 3 ], several
                   interactive identification schemes have been proposed
                   (in particular Fiat-Shamir [ 2 ] and its variants [ 8
                   , 5 , 4 ], Schnorr [ 9 ]). These identifications are
                   based on number theoretical prob- lems. More
                   recently, new schemes appeared with the peculiarity
                   that they are more efficient from the computational
                   point of view and that their security is based on NP
                   -complete problems: PKP (Permuted Ker- nels Problem)
                   [ 10 ], SD (Syndrome Decoding) [ 12 ] and CLE
                   (Constrained Linear Equations) [ 13 ]. We present a
                   new NP -complete linear problem which comes from
                   learn- ing machines: the Perceptrons Problem. We have
                   some constraints, m vectors X i of {−1, +1} n , and
                   we want to find a vector V of {−1, +1} n such that
                   X i · V ≥ 0 for all i . Next, we provide some
                   zero-knowledge interactive identification protocols
                   based on this problem, with an evaluation of their
                   security. Eventually, those protocols are well suited
                   for smart card applications.},

                   resolution of zero-dimensional systems in {K[X} 1,
                   …X n ], where K is a field of characteristic zero
                   (or strictly positive under some conditions). We
                   follow the definition used in {MMM95} and basically
                   due to Kronecker for solving zero-dimensional
                   systems: A system is solved if each root is
                   represented in such way as to allow the performance
                   of any arithmetical operations over the arithmetical
                   expressions of its coordinates. We propose new
                   definitions for solving zero-dimensional systems in
                   this sense by introducing the Univariate
                   Representation of their roots. We show by this way
                   that the solutions of any zero-dimensional system of
                   polynomials can be expressed through a special kind
                   of univariate representation (Rational Univariate
                   Representation): where (f,g,g 1, …,g n ) are
                   polynomials of {K[X} 1, …, X n ]. A special feature
                   of our Rational Univariate Representation is that we
                   dont loose geometrical information contained in the
                   initial system. Moreover we propose different
                   efficient algorithms for the computation of the
                   Rational Univariate Representation, and we make a
                   comparison with standard known tools.},

                   knowledge whatsoever about the assertion except its
                   validity. The practical significance of these proofs
                   was demonstrated in 1986 by Fiat and Shamir, who
                   showed how to use efficient zero knowledge proofs of
                   quadratic residuosity to establish user identities
                   and to digitally sign messages. In this paper we

                   factoring, and thus it widens the basis of public key

                   polynomials over a finite field. We demonstrate that
                   the new baby step/giant step factoring method,
                   recently developed by Kaltofen and Shoup, can be made
                   into a very practical algorithm. We describe an
                   implementation of this algorithm, and present the
                   results of empirical tests comparing this new
                   algorithm with others. When factoring polynomials
                   modulo large primes, the algorithm allows much larger
                   polynomials to be factored using a reasonable amount
                   of time and space than was previously possible. For
                   example, this new software has been used to factor a
                   generic polynomial of degree 2048 modulo a 2048-bit
                   prime in under 12 days on a Sun SPARC-station 10,

                   attempts to build identification protocols that do
                   not rely on arithmetical operations with large
                   numbers but only use simple operations (see [ 10 , 8
                   ]). One was presented at the CRYPTO 89 rump session
                   ([ 8 ]) and depends on the so-called Permuted Kernel
                   problem (PKP). Another appeared in the CRYPTO 93
                   proceedings and is based on the syndrome decoding
                   problem (SD) form the theory of error correcting
                   codes ([ 11 ]). In this paper, we introduce a new
                   scheme of the same family with the distinctive
                   character that both the secret key and the public
                   identification key can be taken to be of short
                   length. By short, we basically mean the usual size of
                   conventional symmetric cryptosystems. As is known,
                   the possibility of using short keys has been a
                   challenge in public key cryptography and has
                   practical applications. Our scheme relies on a
                   combinatorial problem which we call Constrained
                   Linear Equations (CLE in short) and which consists of
                   solving a set of linear equations modulo some small
                   prime q , the unknowns being subject to belong to a
                   specific subset of the integers mod q . Thus, we
                   enlarge the set of tools that can be used in
                   cryptography.},

  abstract  = {Zero-knowledge proofs were introduced in 1985, in a
                   paper by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff ([ 6 ]).
                   Their practical significance was soon demonstrated in
                   the work of Fiat and Shamir ([ 4 ]), who turned
                   zero-knowledge proofs of quadratic residuosity into
                   efficient means of establishing user identities.
                   Still, as is almost always the case in public-key
                   cryptography, the Fiat-Shamir scheme relied on
                   arithmetic operations on large numbers. In 1989,
                   there were two attempts to build identification
                   protocols that only use simple operations (see [ 11 ,
                   10 ]). One appeared in the EUROCRYPT proceedings and
                   relies on the intractability of some coding problems,
                   the other was presented at the CRYPTO rump session
                   and depends on the so-called Permuted Kernel problem
                   (PKP). Unfortunately, the first of the schemes was
                   not really practical. In the present paper, we
                   propose a new identification scheme, based on
                   error-correcting codes, which is zero-knowledge and
                   is of practical value. Furthermore, we describe
                   several variants, including one which has an identity
                   based character. The security of our scheme depends
                   on the hardness of decoding a word of given syndrome
                   w.r.t. some binary linear error-correcting code.},

                   Introduction We consider the problem of factoring a
                   univariate polynomial over a finite field. This
                   problem plays a central role in computational
                   algebra. Indeed, many of the efficient algorithms for
                   factoring univariate and multivariate polynomials
                   over finite fields, the field of rational numbers,
                   and finite extensions of the rationals solve as a
                   subproblem the problem of factoring univariate
                   polynomials over finite fields (Kaltofen 1990). This
                   problem also has important applications in number
                   theory (Buchmann 1990), coding theory (Berlekamp
                   1968), and ...},

                   set S for a k -tuple satisfying some predefined
                   relation, with the promise that some components of a
                   desired k -tuple are in some subsets of S . In
                   particular when k =2, we show a tight bound of the
                   quantum query complexity for the Claw Finding
                   problem, improving previous upper and lower bounds by
                   Buhrman, Durr, Heiligman, Hoyer, Magniez, Santha and
                   de Wolf [7]. We also consider the distributed
                   scenario, where two parties each holds an n -element
                   set, and they want to decide whether the two sets
                   share a common element. We show a family of protocols
                   s . t . q ( P ) 3/2 . c ( P )= O ( n 2 log n ), where
                   q ( P ) and c ( P ) are the number of quantum queries
                   and the number of communication qubits that the
                   protocol P makes, respectively. This implies that we
                   can pay more for quantum queries to save on quantum
                   communication, and vice versa. To our knowledge, it
                   is the first result about the tradeoff between the

We explain how this method can be used to construct hyperelliptic cryptosystems which could be as secure as cryptosystems based on the original elliptic curve. On the other hand, we show that the same technique may provide a way of attacking the original elliptic curve cryptosystem using recent advances in the study of the discrete logarithm problem on hyperelliptic curves.  We examine the resulting higher genus curves in some detail and propose an additional check on elliptic curve systems defined over fields of characteristic 2 so as to make them immune from the methods in this paper.},
