 Finally, we present efficient formulas for Jacobi quartic curves with twists of degree 4 or 6. For twists of degree 4, both the addition steps and doubling steps in our formulas are faster than the fastest result on Weierstrass curves. For twists of degree 6, the addition steps of our formulae are faster than the fastest result on Weierstrass curves.},

@electronic{arana+etal12-koblitz_curves,
    abstract = {We design a state-of-the-art software implementation of field and elliptic curve arithmetic in standard Koblitz curves at the 128-bit security level. Field arithmetic is carefully crafted by using the best formulae and implementation strategies available, and the increasingly common native support to binary field arithmetic in modern desktop computing platforms. The i-th power of the Frobenius automorphism on Koblitz curves is exploited to obtain new and faster interleaved versions of the well-known \$\tau\$NAF scalar multiplication algorithm. The usage of the \$\tau^{\lfloor m/3 \rfloor}\$ and
 \$\tau^{\lfloor m/4 \rfloor}\$ maps are employed to create analogues of the 3-and 4-dimensional GLV decompositions and in general, the \$\lfloor m/s \rfloor\$-th power of the Frobenius automorphism is applied as an analogue of an \$s\$-dimensional GLV decomposition. The effectiveness of these techniques is illustrated by timing the scalar multiplication operation for fixed, random and multiple points. To our knowledge, our library was the first to compute a random point scalar multiplication in less than 10^5 clock cycles among all curves with or without endomorphisms defined over binary or prime fields. The results of our optimized implementation suggest a trade-off between speed, compliance with the published standards and side-channel protection. Finally, we estimate the performance of curve-based cryptographic protocols instantiated using the proposed techniques and compare our results to related work.},

@electronic{defeo+jao+plut12,
    abstract = {We present new candidates for quantum-resistant public-key cryptosystems based on the conjectured difficulty of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves.  The main technical idea in our scheme is that we transmit the images of torsion bases under the isogeny in order to allow the parties to construct a shared commutative square despite the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring.  Our work is motivated by the recent development of a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic curves. In the supersingular case, by contrast, the fastest known quantum attack remains exponential, since the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring means that the approach used in the ordinary case does not apply. We give a precise formulation of the necessary computational assumptions along with a discussion of their validity, and prove the security of our protocols under these assumptions. In addition, we present implementation results showing that our protocols are multiple orders of magnitude faster than previous isogeny-based cryptosystems over ordinary curves. <P> This paper is an extended version of\~{}\cite{pqcrypto}. We add a new zero-knowledge identification scheme, and detailed security proofs for the protocols. We also present a new, asymptotically faster, algorithm for key generation, a thorough study of its optimization, and new experimental data.},

In particular when k =2, we show a tight bound of the quantum query complexity for the Claw Finding problem, improving previous upper and lower bounds by Buhrman, Durr, Heiligman, Hoyer, Magniez, Santha and de Wolf [7]. We also consider the distributed scenario, where two parties each holds an n -element set, and they want to decide whether the two sets share a common element. We show a family of protocols s . t . q ( P ) 3/2 . c ( P )= O ( n 2 log n ), where q ( P ) and c ( P ) are the number of quantum queries and the number of communication qubits that the protocol P makes, respectively. This implies that we can pay more for quantum queries to save on quantum communication, and vice versa. To our knowledge, it is the first result about the tradeoff between the two resources.}},

@article{montgomery,
    abstract = {Since 1974, several algorithms have been developed that attempt to factor a large number \\$N\\$ by doing extensive computations modulo \\$N\\$ and occasionally taking {GCDs} with \\$N\\$. These began with Pollard's \\$p - 1\\$ and Monte Carlo methods. More recently, Williams published a \\$p + 1\\$ method, and Lenstra discovered an elliptic curve method ({ECM}). We present ways to speed all of these. One improvement uses two tables during the second phases of \\$p \\pm 1\\$ and {ECM}, looking for a match. Polynomial preconditioning lets us search a fixed table of size \\$n\\$ with \\$n/2 + o(n)\\$ multiplications. A parametrization of elliptic curves lets Step 1 of {ECM} compute the \\$x\\$-coordinate of \\${nP}\\$ from that of \\$P\\$ in about \\$9.3 \\log\_2 n\\$ multiplications for arbitrary \\$P\\$.},

Tate's isogeny theorem states that there is an isogeny from E1 to E2 which is defined over Fp. The goal of this paper is to describe a probabilistic algorithm for constructing such an {isogeny.The} algorithm proposed in this paper has exponential complexity in the worst case. Nevertheless, it is efficient in certain situations (that is, when the class number of the endomorphism ring is small). The significance of these results to elliptic curve cryptography is discussed.},

    abstract = {We present new algorithms related to both theoretical and practical questions in the area of elliptic curves and class field theory. The dissertation has two main parts, as described below. Let O be an imaginary quadratic order of discriminant D < 0, and let K = √ Q( D). The class polynomial {HD} of O is the polynomial whose roots are precisely the j-invariants of elliptic curves with complex multiplication by O. Computing this polynomial is useful in constructing elliptic curves suitable for cryptography, as well as in the context of explicit class field theory. In the first part of the dissertation, we present an algorithm to compute {HD} p-adically where p is a prime inert in K and not dividing D. ̃ This involves computing the canonical lift E of a pair (E, f ) where E is a supersingular elliptic curve and f is an embedding of O into the endomorphism ring of E. We also present an algorithm to compute {HD} modulo p for p inert which is used in the Chinese remainder theorem algorithm to compute {HD} . For an elliptic curve E over any field K, the Weil pairing en is a bilinear map on the points of order n of E. The Weil pairing is a useful tool in both the theory of elliptic curves and the application of elliptic curves to cryptography. However, for K of characteristic p, the classical Weil pairing on the points of order p is trivial. In the second part of the dissertation, we consider E over the dual numbers K[ ] and define a non-degenerate ” Weil pairing on p-torsion.” We show that this pairing satisfies many of the same properties of the classical pairing. Moreover, we show that it directly relates to recent attacks on the discrete logarithm problem on the p-torsion subgroup of an elliptic curve over the finite field Fq . We also present a new attack on the discrete logarithm problem on anomalous curves using a lift of E over Fp [ ].},

The infeasibility of this problem assures the security of some cryptographic schemes. In 2006, Cheon proposed a novel algorithm for solving {DLPwAI} (Cheon's algorithm). This paper reports our experimental results of Cheon's algorithm by implementing it with some speeding-up techniques.

    abstract = {In the last few years, there have been several attempts to build identification protocols that do not rely on arithmetical operations with large numbers but only use simple operations (see [ 10 , 8 ]). One was presented at the {CRYPTO} 89 rump session ([ 8 ]) and depends on the so-called Permuted Kernel problem ({PKP}). Another appeared in the {CRYPTO} 93 proceedings and is based on the syndrome decoding problem ({SD}) form the theory of error correcting codes ([ 11 ]). In this paper, we introduce a new scheme of the same family with the distinctive character that both the secret key and the public identification key can be taken to be of short length. By short, we basically mean the usual size of conventional symmetric cryptosystems. As is known, the possibility of using short keys has been a challenge in public key cryptography and has practical applications. Our scheme relies on a combinatorial problem which we call Constrained Linear Equations ({CLE} in short) and which consists of solving a set of linear equations modulo some small prime q , the unknowns being subject to belong to a specific subset of the integers mod q . Thus, we enlarge the set of tools that can be used in cryptography.},

@inproceedings{stern94-SD,
    abstract = {Zero-knowledge proofs were introduced in 1985, in a paper by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff ([ 6 ]). Their practical significance was soon demonstrated in the work of Fiat and Shamir ([ 4 ]), who turned zero-knowledge proofs of quadratic residuosity into efficient means of establishing user identities. Still, as is almost always the case in public-key cryptography, the {Fiat-Shamir} scheme relied on arithmetic operations on large numbers. In 1989, there were two attempts to build identification protocols that only use simple operations (see [ 11 , 10 ]). One appeared in the {EUROCRYPT} proceedings and relies on the intractability of some coding problems, the other was presented at the {CRYPTO} rump session and depends on the so-called Permuted Kernel problem ({PKP}). Unfortunately, the first of the schemes was not really practical. In the present paper, we propose a new identification scheme, based on error-correcting codes, which is zero-knowledge and is of practical value. Furthermore, we describe several variants, including one which has an identity based character. The security of our scheme depends on the hardness of decoding a word of given syndrome w.r.t. some binary linear error-correcting code.},

Since zero-know- ledge theory appeared [ 3 ], several interactive identification schemes have been proposed (in particular Fiat-Shamir [ 2 ] and its variants [ 8 , 5 , 4 ], Schnorr [ 9 ]). These identifications are based on number theoretical prob- lems. More recently, new schemes appeared with the peculiarity that they are more efficient from the computational point of view and that their security is based on NP -complete problems: PKP (Permuted Ker- nels Problem) [ 10 ], SD (Syndrome Decoding) [ 12 ] and CLE (Constrained Linear Equations) [ 13 ]. We present a new NP -complete linear problem which comes from learn- ing machines: the Perceptrons Problem. We have some constraints, m vectors X i of {−1, +1} n , and we want to find a vector V of {−1, +1} n such that X i · V ≥ 0 for all i . Next, we provide some zero-knowledge interactive identification protocols based on this problem, with an evaluation of their security. Eventually, those protocols are well suited for smart card applications.},

This leads to the definition of unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge in which the prover demonstrates possession of knowledge without revealing any computational information whatsoever (not even the one bit revealed in zero-knowledge proofs of assertions). We show the relevance of these notions to identification schemes, in which parties prove their identity by demonstrating their knowledge rather than by proving the validity of assertions. We describe a novel scheme which is provably secure if factoring is difficult and whose practical implementations are about two orders of magnitude faster than {RSA}-based identification schemes. The advantages of thinking in terms of proofs of knowledge rather than proofs of assertions are demonstrated in two efficient variants of the scheme: unrestricted input zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge are used in the construction of a scheme which needs no directory; a version of the scheme based on parallel interactive proofs (which are not known to be zero knowledge) is proved secure by observing that the identification protocols are proofs of knowledge.},

    abstract = {In 1974, Ralph Merkle proposed the first unclassified scheme for secure
communications over insecure channels. When legitimate communicating parties
are willing to spend an amount of computational effort proportional to some
parameter N, an eavesdropper cannot break into their communication without
spending a time proportional to N^2, which is quadratically more than the
legitimate effort. We showed in an earlier paper that Merkle's schemes are
completely insecure against a quantum adversary, but that their security can be
partially restored if the legitimate parties are also allowed to use quantum
computation: the eavesdropper needed to spend a time proportional to N^{3/2} to
break our earlier quantum scheme. Furthermore, all previous classical schemes
could be broken completely by the onslaught of a quantum eavesdropper and we
conjectured that this is unavoidable.


We give two novel key establishment schemes in the spirit of Merkle's. The
first one can be broken by a quantum adversary that makes an effort
proportional to N^{5/3} to implement a quantum random walk in a Johnson graph
reminiscent of Andris Ambainis' quantum algorithm for the element distinctness
problem. This attack is optimal up to logarithmic factors. Our second scheme is
purely classical, yet it cannot be broken by a quantum eavesdropper who is only
willing to expend effort proportional to that of the legitimate parties.},

    abstract = {Quantum computers can break the RSA and El Gamal public-key cryptosystems,
since they can factor integers and extract discrete logarithms. If we believe
that quantum computers will someday become a reality, we would like to have
\emph{post-quantum} cryptosystems which can be implemented today with classical
computers, but which will remain secure even in the presence of quantum
attacks.


In this article we show that the McEliece cryptosystem over
\emph{well-permuted, well-scrambled} linear codes resists precisely the attacks
to which the RSA and El Gamal cryptosystems are vulnerable--namely, those
based on generating and measuring coset states. This eliminates the approach of
strong Fourier sampling on which almost all known exponential speedups by
quantum algorithms are based. Specifically, we show that the natural case of
the Hidden Subgroup Problem to which the McEliece cryptosystem reduces cannot
be solved by strong Fourier sampling, or by any measurement of a coset state.
We start with recent negative results on quantum algorithms for Graph
Isomorphism, which are based on particular subgroups of size two, and extend
them to subgroups of arbitrary structure, including the automorphism groups of
linear codes. This allows us to obtain the first rigorous results on the
security of the McEliece cryptosystem in the face of quantum adversaries,
strengthening its candidacy for post-quantum cryptography.},

@article{dinh+morre+russel11,
    abstract = {The Code Equivalence problem is that of determining whether two given linear
codes are equivalent to each other up to a permutation of the coordinates. This
problem has a direct reduction to a nonabelian hidden subgroup problem ({HSP}),
suggesting a possible quantum algorithm analogous to Shor's algorithms for
factoring or discrete log. However, we recently showed that in many cases of
interest--including Goppa codes--solving this case of the {HSP} requires rich,
entangled measurements. Thus, solving these cases of Code Equivalence via
Fourier sampling appears to be out of reach of current families of quantum
algorithms.


Code equivalence is directly related to the security of {McEliece}-type
cryptosystems in the case where the private code is known to the adversary.
However, for many codes the support splitting algorithm of Sendrier provides a
classical attack in this case. We revisit the claims of our previous article in
the light of these classical attacks, and discuss the particular case of the
Sidelnikov cryptosystem, which is based on {Reed-Muller} codes.},

@inproceedings{jao+defeo2011,
    abstract = {We present new candidates for quantum-resistant public-key cryptosystems based on the conjectured difficulty of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. The main technical idea in our scheme is that we transmit the images of torsion bases under the isogeny in order to allow the two parties to arrive at a common shared key despite the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring. Our work is motivated by the recent development of a subexponential-time quantum algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic curves. In the supersingular case, by contrast, the fastest known quantum attack remains exponential, since the noncommutativity of the endomorphism ring means that the approach used in the ordinary case does not apply. We give a precise formulation of the necessary computational assumption along with a discussion of its validity. In addition, we present implementation results showing that our protocols are multiple orders of magnitude faster than previous isogeny-based cryptosystems over ordinary curves.},

    abstract = {The GLV method of Gallant, Lambert and Vanstone (CRYPTO 2001) computes any
multiple \$kP\$ of a point \$P\$ of prime order \$n\$ lying on an elliptic curve with
a low-degree endomorphism \$\Phi\$ (called GLV curve) over \$\mathbb{F}\_p\$ as


\[kP = k\_1P + k\_2\Phi(P), \quad\text{with} \max\{|k\_1|,|k\_2|\}\leq C\sqrt n\]


for some explicit constant \$C>0\$. Recently, Galbraith, Lin and Scott
(EUROCRYPT 2009) extended this method to all curves over \$\mathbb{F}\_{p^2}\$
which are twists of curves defined over \$\mathbb{F}\_p\$. These are examples of
two-dimensional decompositions (with two new scalars), and the GLS approach
shows that for curves with many automorphisms (cubic and quartic twists) one
can achieve a four-dimensional decomposition as well.


We show in this work how to merge the two approaches in order to get, for
twists of any GLV curve over \$\mathbb{F}\_{p^2}\$, a four-dimensional
decomposition together with fast endomorphisms \$\Phi, \Psi\$ over
\$\mathbb{F}\_{p^2}\$ acting on the group generated by a point \$P\$ of prime order
\$n\$, resulting in a proved decomposition for any scalar \$k\in[1,n]\$ \$\$ kP=k\_1P+
k\_2\Phi(P)+ k\_3\Psi(P) + k\_4\Psi\Phi(P)\quad \text{with} \max\_i (|k\_i|)< C
n^{1/4} \$\$ for some explicitly computable \$C>0\$. If parallel computation is
available, then the computation of \$kP\$ can possibly be implemented up to four
times as fast as a traditional scalar multiplication.


We also derive new families of GLV curves, corresponding to those curves with
degree 3 endomorphisms.


Finally, we present a faster approach to produce a better proven
decomposition inspired by the original GLV method, which computes the reduced
kernel lattice basis using a truncated form of the Euclidean algorithm instead
of the LLL algorithm.},

    abstract = {A low storage algorithm for constructing isogenies between ordinary elliptic
curves was proposed by Galbraith, Hess and Smart ({GHS}). We give an improvement
of this algorithm by modifying the pseudorandom walk so that lower-degree
isogenies are used more frequently. This is motivated by the fact that high
degree isogenies are slower to compute than low degree ones. We analyse the
running time of the parallel collision search algorithm when the partitioning
is uneven. We also give experimental results. We conclude that our algorithm is
around 14 times faster than the {GHS} algorithm when constructing horizontal
isogenies between random isogenous elliptic curves over a 160-bit prime field.


The results apply to generic adding walks and the more general group action
inverse problem; a speed-up is obtained whenever the cost of computing edges in
the graph varies significantly.},

    abstract = {The problem of error-control in random linear network coding is considered. A ldquononcoherentrdquo or ldquochannel obliviousrdquo model is assumed where neither transmitter nor receiver is assumed to have knowledge of the channel transfer characteristic. Motivated by the property that linear network coding is vector-space preserving, information transmission is modeled as the injection into the network of a basis for a vector space  V  and the collection by the receiver of a basis for a vector space  U . A metric on the projective geometry associated with the packet space is introduced, and it is shown that a minimum-distance decoder for this metric achieves correct decoding if the dimension of the space  V  cap U  is sufficiently large. If the dimension of each codeword is restricted to a fixed integer, the code forms a subset of a finite-field Grassmannian, or, equivalently, a subset of the vertices of the corresponding Grassmann graph. Sphere-packing and sphere-covering bounds as well as a generalization of the singleton bound are provided for such codes. Finally, a {Reed-Solomon}-like code construction, related to Gabidulin's construction of maximum rank-distance codes, is described and a Sudan-style ldquolist-1rdquo minimum-distance decoding algorithm is provided.},

@article{silva+kschi+koetter08,
    abstract = {The problem of error control in random linear network coding is addressed from a matrix perspective that is closely related to the subspace perspective of Rotter and Kschischang. A large class of constant-dimension subspace codes is investigated. It is shown that codes in this class can be easily constructed from rank-metric codes, while preserving their distance properties. Moreover, it is shown that minimum distance decoding of such subspace codes can be reformulated as a generalized decoding problem for rank-metric codes where partial information about the error is available. This partial information may be in the form of erasures (knowledge of an error location but not its value) and deviations (knowledge of an error value but not its location). Taking erasures and deviations into account (when they occur) strictly increases the error correction capability of a code: if mu erasures and delta deviations occur, then errors of rank t can always be corrected provided that 2t les d - 1 + mu + delta, where d is the minimum rank distance of the code. For Gabidulin codes, an important family of maximum rank distance codes, an efficient decoding algorithm is proposed that can properly exploit erasures and deviations. In a network coding application, where n packets of length M over F(q) are transmitted, the complexity of the decoding algorithm is given by {O(dM}) operations in an extension field F(q n ).},

Many applications in cryptography require evaluating large degree isogenies between elliptic curves efficiently. For ordinary curves of the same endomorphism ring, the previous best known algorithm has a worst case running time which is exponential in the length of the input. In this paper we show this problem can be solved in subexponential time under reasonable heuristics. Our approach is based on factoring the ideal corresponding to the kernel of the isogeny, modulo principal ideals, into a product of smaller prime ideals for which the isogenies can be computed directly. Combined with previous work of Bostan et al., our algorithm yields equations for large degree isogenies in quasi-optimal time given only the starting curve and the kernel.},

@unpublished{beecken+mittman+saxena11,
    abstract = {Algebraic independence is an advanced notion in commutative algebra that
generalizes independence of linear polynomials to higher degree. Polynomials
{f\_1, ..., f\_m} \subset \F[x\_1, ..., x\_n] are called algebraically independent
if there is no non-zero polynomial F such that F(f\_1, ..., f\_m) = 0. The
transcendence degree, trdeg{f\_1, ..., f\_m}, is the maximal number r of
algebraically independent polynomials in the set. In this paper we design
blackbox and efficient linear maps \phi that reduce the number of variables
from n to r but maintain trdeg{\phi(f\_i)}\_i = r, assuming f\_i's sparse and
small r. We apply these fundamental maps to solve several cases of blackbox
identity testing:


(1) Given a polynomial-degree circuit C and sparse polynomials f\_1, ..., f\_m
with trdeg r, we can test blackbox D := C(f\_1, ..., f\_m) for zeroness in
poly(size(D))^r time.


(2) Define a spsp\_\delta(k,s,n) circuit C to be of the form \sum\_{i=1}^k
\prod\_{j=1}^s f\_{i,j}, where f\_{i,j} are sparse n-variate polynomials of degree
at most \delta. For k = 2 we give a poly(sn\delta)^{\delta^2} time blackbox
identity test.


(3) For a general depth-4 circuit we define a notion of rank. Assuming there
is a rank bound R for minimal simple spsp\_\delta(k,s,n) identities, we give a
poly(snR\delta)^{Rk\delta^2} time blackbox identity test for spsp\_\delta(k,s,n)
circuits. This partially generalizes the state of the art of depth-3 to depth-4
circuits.


The notion of trdeg works best with large or zero characteristic, but we also
give versions of our results for arbitrary fields.},

of isolating the real roots of a univariate polynomial in \$B\_{\alpha} \in

approach using resultant computations we perform a reduction to a polynomial
with integer coefficients. We compute separation bounds for the roots, and
using them we deduce that we can isolate the real roots of \$B\_{\alpha}\$ in
\$\sOB(N^{10})\$, where \$N\$ is an upper bound on all the quantities (degree and
bitsize) of the input polynomials. In the second approach we isolate the real
roots working directly on the polynomial of the input. We compute improved
separation bounds for real roots and we prove that they are optimal, under mild
assumptions. For isolating the roots we consider a modified Sturm's algorithm,
and a modified version of \func{descartes}' algorithm introduced by Sagraloff.
For the former we prove a complexity bound of \$\sOB(N^8)\$ and for the latter a
bound of \$\sOB(N^{7})\$. We implemented the algorithms in \func{C} as part of
the core library of \mathematica and we illustrate their efficiency over

    abstract = {Decomposing the domain of a function into parts has many uses in mathematics. A domain may naturally be a union of pieces, a function may be defined by cases, or different boundary conditions may hold on different regions. For any particular problem the domain can be given explicitly, but when dealing with a family of problems given in terms of symbolic parameters, matters become more difficult. This article shows how hybrid sets, that is multisets allowing negative multiplicity, may be used to express symbolic domain decompositions in an efficient, elegant and uniform way, simplifying both computation and reasoning. We apply this theory to the arithmetic of piecewise functions and symbolic matrices and show how certain operations may be reduced from exponential to linear complexity.},

    abstract = {The pattern matching calculi introduced by the first author are a refinement of the \$\\lambda\$-calculus that integrates mechanisms appropriate for fine-grained modelling of non-strict pattern matching. While related work in the literature only uses a single monad, typically \\textsf{Maybe}, for matchings, we present an axiomatic approach to semantics of these pattern matching calculi using two monads, one for expressions and one for matchings. Although these two monads only need to be relatively lightly coupled, this semantics implies soundness of all core \$\\PMC\$ rules, and is a useful tool for exploration of the design space for pattern matching calculi. Using lifting and \\textsf{Maybe} monads, we obtain standard Haskell semantics, and by adding another level of \\textsf{Maybe} to both, we obtain a denotational semantics of the ``matching failure as exceptions'' approach of Erwig and Peyton Jones. Using list-like monads opens up interesting extensions in the direction of functional-logic programming. A short version of this report appears as \\cite{Kahl-Carette-Ji-2006a}.},

Recall that on input of f and g the extended Euclidean algorithm computes a sequence of polynomials (si, ti, ri) satisfying sif + tig = ri. Thus for i with gcd(ti, f) = 1, we obtain rational functions ri/ti ∈ F(t) satisfying ri/ti ≡ g (mod {f).In} this paper we modify the fast extended Euclidean algorithm to compute the smallest ri/ti, that is, an ri/ti minimizing deg ri + deg ti. This means that in an output sensitive modular algorithm when we are recovering rational functions in F(t) from their images modulo f(t) where f(t) is increasing in degree, we can recover them as soon as the degree of f is large enough and we can do this {fast.We} have implemented our modified fast Euclidean algorithm for F = Zp, p a word sized prime, in Java. Our fast algorithm beats the ordinary Euclidean algorithm around degree 200. This has application to polynomial gcd computation and linear algebra over Zp(t).},

    abstract = {Since the proof in 1982, by Tsfasman Vladut and Zink of theexistence of algebraic-geometric ({AG}) codes with asymptotic performanceexceeding the {Gilbert-Varshamov} ({G-V}) bound, one of the challenges incoding theory has been to provide explicit constructions for thesecodes. In a major step forward during 1995-1996, Garcia and {Stichtenoth(GS}) provided an explicit description of algebraic curves, such that {AGcodes} constructed on them would have a performance better than the {G-Vbound}. We present the first low-complexity algorithm for obtaining thegenerator matrix for {AG} codes on the curves of {GS}. The symbol alphabetof the {AG} code is the finite field of q 2 ,q 2 \&ges;49, elements. The complexity of the algorithm, asmeasured in terms of multiplications and divisions over the finite {fieldGF}(q 2 ), is upper-bounded by [Nlog q (N)] 3 where N is the length of the code. An example of code construction usingthe above algorithm is presented. By concatenating the {AG} code withshort binary block codes, it is possible to obtain binary codes withasymptotic performance close to the {G-V} bound. Some examples of suchconcatenation are included},

In connection with elliptic curves over finite fields, the problem becomes the following: compute an isogeny (an algebraic homomorphism) between the elliptic curves given. The problem seems to be hard for solving with a quantum computer. {ElGamal} public-key encryption and {Diffie-Hellman} key agreement are proposed for an isogeny cryptosystem. The paper describes theoretical background and a public-key encryption technique, followed by security analysis and consideration of cryptosystem parameters selection. A demonstrative example of encryption is included as well.},

We provide explicit formulae for isogenies with kernel isomorphic to\^{A} (\^{a}¤/2\^{a}¤)3 (over an algebraic closure of the base field) for any hyperelliptic genus\^{A} 3 curve over a field of characteristic not\^{A} 2 or\^{A} 3. These isogenies are rational for a positive fraction of all hyperelliptic genus\^{A} 3 curves defined over a finite field of characteristic\^{A} p>3. Subject to reasonable assumptions, our constructions give an explicit and efficient reduction of instances of the {DLP} from hyperelliptic to non-hyperelliptic Jacobians for around\^{A} 18.57\% of all hyperelliptic genus\^{A} 3 curves over a given finite field. We conclude with a discussion on extending these ideas to isogenies with more general kernels.},

We explain how this method can be used to construct hyperelliptic cryptosystems which could be as secure as cryptosystems based on the original elliptic curve. On the other hand, we show that the same technique may provide a way of attacking the original elliptic curve cryptosystem using recent advances in the study of the discrete logarithm problem on hyperelliptic curves.  We examine the resulting higher genus curves in some detail and propose an additional check on elliptic curve systems defined over fields of characteristic 2 so as to make them immune from the methods in this paper.},

    abstract = {We study a number of embedded {DSLs} for autonomous ordinary differential equations (autonomous {ODEs}) in Haskell. A naive implementation based on the lazy tower of derivatives is straightforward but has serious time and space leaks due to the loss of sharing when handling cyclic and infinite data structures. In seeking a solution to fix this problem, we explore a number of {DSLs} ranging from shallow to deep embeddings, and middle-grounds in between. We advocate a solution based on arrows, an abstract notion of computation that offers both a succinct representation and an effective implementation. Arrows are ubiquitous in their combinator style that happens to capture both sharing and recursion elegantly. We further relate our arrow-based {DSL} to a more constrained form of arrows called causal commutative arrows, the normalization of which leads to a staged compilation technique improving {ODE} performance by orders of magnitude.},

We show that over large enough fields, the bilinear complexity of the product modulo a monomial ideal  M  is bounded by the product of the regularity of  M  by the degree of  M . In some special cases, such as partial degree truncation, this estimate carries over to total complexity. This leads to complexity improvements for some basic algorithms with algebraic numbers, and some polynomial system solving algorithms.},

    abstract = {The motivation for this paper is the following: In several examples,when the radical of an ideal \$\scr I\$ of \$k[X\_1,\cdots,X\_n]\$ iscomputed (in order to compute \$V(\scr I))\$, and one coordinate isexpressed as the zeros of a univariate polynomial with the othercoordinates being polynomial functions of this first coordinate (theshape lemma), then the sizes of the coefficients of this univariatepolynomial are not very big. For the other polynomials involved thisis not the case. And, in any case, the computation is difficult.<P> The authors define the Chow polynomial in order to describe the pointsof \$V(\scr I)\$ through the zeros of a \$u\$-Chow polynomial, where \$u\inA=k[X\_1,\cdots,X\_n]/\scr I\$ is well chosen: for each multiplicity\$µ\$ which may occur for points in \$V(\scr I)\$ the \$u\$-Chowpolynomial gives a rational expression for the coordinates of eachpoint of \$V(\scr I)\$ with multiplicity \$µ\$. This leads to a globalrational computation of the points of \$V(\scr I)\$.<P> The \$u\$-Chow polynomial also gives information on which multiplicitiesmay occur: a rational function on \$V(\scr I)\$ represents themultiplicity \$µ\$ of a zero.<P> Again using the \$u\$-Chow polynomial the authors describe a method forcomputing the decomposition of \$A\$ into its local components, i.e.\for computing the indecomposable idempotents in \$A\$. They apply thesemethods first when \$A\$ is given through a Gr\"{o}bner basis, and thendescribe the computations from the knowledge of the multiplicationtables in \$A\$. Then, when \$A\$ is a complete intersection, adeformation is easily performed in order to compute a Gr\"{o}bner basisin the modified situation and to obtain information for \$A\$.<P>{For the entire collection see <A HREF="/msnmain?fn=105\&fmt=doc\&r=1\&pg1=CNO\&s1=1414441\&loc=fromrevtext">MR1414441 (97d:14002)</A>.}},

    abstract = {This paper introduces a new efficient algorithm for computing Grobner bases. To avoid as much intermediate computation as possible, the algorithm computes successive truncated Grobner bases and it replaces the classical polynomial reduction found in the Buchberger algorithm by the simultaneous reduction of several polynomials. This powerful reduction mechanism is achieved by means of a symbolic precomputation and by extensive use of sparse linear algebra methods. Current techniques in linear algebra used in Computer Algebra are reviewed together with other methods coming from the numerical field. Some previously untractable problems (Cyclic 9) are presented as well as an empirical comparison of a first implementation of this algorithm with other well known programs. This comparison pays careful attention to methodology issues. All the benchmarks and {CPU} times used in this paper are frequently updated and available on a Web page. Even though the new algorithm does not improve the worst case complexity it is several times faster than previous implementations both for integers and modulo p computations.},

    abstract = {Undeniable signatures were proposed to limit the verification property of ordinary digital signatures. In fact, the verification of such signatures cannot be attained without the help of the signer, via the confirmation/denial protocols. Later, the concept was refined to give the possibility of converting the issued undeniable signatures into ordinary ones by publishing a universal receipt that turns them publicly verifiable. In this paper, we present the first generic construction for universally convertible undeniable signatures from certain weakly secure cryptosystems and any secure digital signature scheme. Next, we give two specific approaches for building universally convertible undeniable signatures from a large class of pairing-based signatures. These methods find a nice and practical instantiation with known encryption and signature schemes. For instance, we achieve the most efficient undeniable signatures with regard to the signature length and cost, the underlying assumption and the security model. We believe these constructions could be an interesting starting point to develop more efficient schemes or give better security analyses of the existing ones.},

The discrete logarithm problem can therefore be solved using index calculus algorithms as long as k is small. In the elliptic curve case it was shown by Menezes, Okamoto and Vanstone that for supersingular curves one has k ⪯ 6. In this paper curves of higher genus are studied. Bounds on the possible values for k in the case of supersingular curves are given which imply that supersingular curves are weaker than the general case for cryptography. Ways to ensure that a curve is not supersingular are also discussed. A constructive application of supersingular curves to cryptography is given, by generalising an identity-based cryptosystem due to Boneh and Franklin. The generalised scheme provides a significant reduction in bandwidth compared with the original scheme.},

    abstract = {Standard homological algebra is not constructive, and this is frequently the source of serious problems when algorithms are looked for. In particular the usual exact and spectral sequences of homological algebra frequently are not sufficient to obtain some unknown homology or homotopy group. We will explain it is not difficult to fill in this gap, the main tools being on one hand, from a mathematical point of view, the so-called Homological Perturbation Lemma, and on the other hand, from a computational point of view, Functional Programming.     We will illustrate this area of constructive mathematics by applications in two domains:     a) Commutative Algebra frequently meets homological objects, in particular when resolutions are involved (syzygies). Constructive Homological Algebra produces new methods to process old problems such as homology of Koszul complexes, resolutions, minimal resolutions. The solutions so obtained are constructive and therefore more complete than the usual ones, an important point for their concrete use.     b) Algebraic Topology is the historical origin of Homological Algebra. The usual exact and spectral sequences of Algebraic Topology can be easily transformed into new effective versions, giving algorithms computing for example unknown homology and homotopy groups. In particular the effective version of the {Eilenberg-Moore} spectral sequence gives a very simple solution for the old Adams' problem: what algorithm could compute the homology groups of iterated loop spaces?     Machine programs and machine demonstrations will also concretely illustrate the theoretical results so obtained.},

    abstract = {Abstract   We propose constructing provable collision resistant hash functions from expander graphs in which finding cycles is hard. As examples, we investigate two specific families of optimal expander graphs for provable collision resistant hash function constructions: the families of Ramanujan graphs constructed by {Lubotzky-Phillips}-Sarnak and Pizer respectively. When the hash function is constructed from one of Pizer's Ramanujan graphs, (the set of supersingular elliptic curves over with ℓ-isogenies, ℓ a prime different from p), then collision resistance follows from hardness of computing isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. For the {LPS} graphs, the underlying hard problem is a representation problem in group theory. Constructing our hash functions from optimal expander graphs implies that the outputs closely approximate the uniform distribution. This property is useful for arguing that the output is indistinguishable from random sequences of bits. We estimate the cost per bit to compute these hash functions, and we implement our hash function for several members of the Pizer and {LPS} graph families and give actual timings.},

    abstract = {We describe an efficient algorithm for the computation of separable isogenies
between abelian varieties represented in the coordinate system given by
algebraic theta functions. Let \$A\$ be an abelian variety of dimension \$g\$
defined over a field of odd characteristic. Our algorithm decomposes in two
principal steps. First, given a theta null point for \$A\$ and a subgroup \$K\$
isotropic for the Weil pairing, we explain how to compute the theta null point
corresponding to the quotient abelian variety \$A/K\$. Then, from the knowledge
of a theta null point of \$A/K\$, we give an algorithm to obtain a rational
expression for an isogeny from \$A\$ to \$A/K\$. The algorithm resulting as the
combination of these two steps can be viewed as a higher dimensional analog of
the well known algorithm of V\'elu to compute isogenies between elliptic
curves. In the case that \$K\$ is isomorphic to \$(\Z / \ell \Z)^g\$ for \$\ell \in
\N^*\$, the overall time complexity of this algorithm is equivalent to \$O(\log
\ell)\$ additions in \$A\$ and a constant number of \$\ell^{th}\$ root extractions
in the base field of \$A\$. In order to improve the efficiency of our algorithms,
we introduce a compressed representation that allows to encode a point of level
\$4\ell\$ of a \$g\$ dimensional abelian variety using only \$g(g+1)/2\cdot 4^g\$
coordinates. We also give formulas to compute the Weil and commutator pairings
given input points in theta coordinates.},

The paper vastly generalizes previous work since in practice all known cases, e.g. hyperelliptic, superelliptic and Cab curves, can be transformed to fit the nondegenerate case. For curves with a fixed Newton polytope, the property of being nondegenerate is generic, so that the algorithm works for almost all curves with given Newton polytope. For a genus g curve over Fpn, the expected running time {is�O}(n 3 g 6 + n 2 g 6.5), whereas the space complexity amounts {to�O}(n 3 g 4), assuming p is fixed.

@article{pila90,
    abstract = {We give a generalization to Abelian varieties over finite fields of the algorithm of Schoof for elliptic curves. Schoof showed that for an elliptic curve \$E\$ over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$, given by a Weierstrass equation, one can compute the number of \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$-rational points of \$E\$ in time \$O((\log q)^9)\$. Our result is the following. Let \$A\$ be an Abelian variety over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$. Then one can compute the characteristic polynomial of the Frobenius endomorphism of \$A\$ in time \$O((\log q)^\Delta)\$, where \$\Delta\$ and the implied constant depend only on the dimension of the embedding space of \$A\$, the number of equations defining \$A\$ and the addition law, and their degrees. The method, generalizing that of Schoof, is to use the machinery developed by Weil to prove the Riemann hypothesis for Abelian varieties. By means of this theory, the calculation is reduced to ideal-theoretic computations in a ring of polynomials in several variables over \$\mathbf{F}\_q\$. As applications we show how to count the rational points on the reductions modulo primes \$p\$ of a fixed curve over \$\mathbf {Q}\$ in time polynomial in \$\log p\$; we show also that, for a fixed prime \$l\$, we can compute the \$l\$th roots of unity \$\operatorname{mod} p\$, when they exist, in polynomial time in \$\log p\$. This generalizes Schoof's application of his algorithm to find square roots of a fixed integer \$x \operatorname{mod} p\$.},

@incollection{bernstein+lange08,
    abstract = {Edwards recently introduced a new normal form for elliptic curves. Every elliptic curve over a non-binary field is birationally equivalent to a curve in Edwards form over an extension of the field, and in many cases over the original field. This paper presents fast explicit formulas (and register allocations) for group operations on an Edwards curve. The algorithm for doubling uses only {3M} + {4S}, i.e., 3 field multiplications and 4 field squarings. If curve parameters are chosen to be small then the algorithm for mixed addition uses only {9M} + {1S} and the algorithm for non-mixed addition uses only {10M} + {1S}. Arbitrary Edwards curves can be handled at the cost of just one extra multiplication by a curve parameter. For comparison, the fastest algorithms known for the popular  ” a4 = −3 Jacobian” form use {3M} + {5S} for doubling; use {7M} + {4S} for mixed addition; use {11M} + {5S} for non-mixed addition; and use {10M} + {4S} for non-mixed addition when one input has been added before. The explicit formulas for non-mixed addition on an Edwards curve can be used for doublings at no extra cost, simplifying protection against side-channel attacks. Even better, many elliptic curves (approximately 1/4 of all isomorphism classes of elliptic curves over a non-binary finite field) are birationally equivalent — over the original field — to Edwards curves where this addition algorithm works for all pairs of curve points, including inverses, the neutral element, etc. This paper contains an extensive comparison of different forms of elliptic curves and different coordinate systems for the basic group operations (doubling, mixed addition, non-mixed addition, and unified addition) as well as higher-level operations such as multi-scalar multiplication.},

Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be  ” signed” using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in  ” electronic mail” and  ” electronic funds transfer” systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d ≡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

Such a use of orderings requires checking simple ordering constraints on substitutions as an essential part of many operations. Due to their frequency, such checks are costly and are a good target for optimisation. In this paper we present an efficient implementation technique for checking constraints in one of the most widely used simplification orderings, the {Knuth-Bendix} ordering. The technique is based on the idea of run-time algorithm specialisation, which is a close relative of partial evaluation.},

    abstract = {Square matrices serve as an interesting case study in functional programming. Common representations, such as lists of lists, are both inefficient--at least for access to individual elements--and error-prone, because the compiler cannot enforce "squareness". Switching to a typical balanced-tree representation solves the first problem, but not the second. We develop a representation that solves both problems: it offers logarithmic access to each individual element and it captures the shape invariants in the type, where they can be checked by the compiler. One interesting feature of our solution is that it translates the well-known fast exponentiation algorithm to the level of types. Our implementation also provides a stress test for today's advanced type systems--it uses nested types, polymorphic recursion, higher-order kinds, and rank-2 polymorphism.},

A geometric resolution consists of a primitive element of the algebraic extension defined by the set of roots, its minimal polynomial, and the parametrizations of the coordinates. Such a representation of the solutions has a long history which goes back to Leopold Kronecker and has been revisited many times in computer algebra. We introduce a new generation of probabilistic algorithms where all the computations use only univariate or bivariate polynomials. We give a new codification of the set of solutions of a positive dimensional algebraic variety relying on a new global version of Newton's iterator. Roughly speaking the complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in some kind of degree of the system, in its height, and linear in the complexity of evaluation of the system. We present our implementation in the Magma system which is called Kronecker in homage to his method for solving systems of polynomial equations. We show that the theoretical complexity of our algorithm is well reflected in practice and we exhibit some cases for which our program is more efficient than the other available software.},

This differential algebra algorithm computes characteristic sets by change of ranking (ordering) for prime ideals. It identifies the purely algebraic subproblems which arise during differential computations and solves them algebraically. There are two improvements w.r.t. other approaches: formerly unsolved problems could be carried out; it is conceptually simple. Different variants are implemented.},

@article{bostan+salvy+schost03,
    abstract = {Many questions concerning a zero-dimensional polynomial system can be reduced to linear algebra operations in the quotient algebra A= k[ X 1,…, X n]/I, where I is the ideal generated by the input system. Assuming that the multiplicative structure of the algebra A is (partly) known, we address the question of speeding up the linear algebra phase for the computation of minimal polynomials and rational parametrizations in A. We present new formul{\ae} for the rational parametrizations, extending those of Rouillier, and algorithms extending ideas introduced by Shoup in the univariate case. Our approach is based on the A-module structure of the dual space \$\widehat{A}\$ . An important feature of our algorithms is that we do not require \$\widehat{A}\$ to be free and of rank 1. The complexity of our algorithms for computing the minimal polynomial and the rational parametrizations are O(2 nD 5/2) and O( n2 nD 5/2) respectively, where D is the dimension of A. For fixed n, this is better than algorithms based on linear algebra except when the complexity of the available matrix product has exponent less than 5/2.},

    abstract = {Abstract.\&nbsp;\&nbsp; This paper is devoted to the resolution of zero-dimensional systems in {K[X} 1, …X n ], where K is a field of characteristic zero (or strictly positive under some conditions). We follow the definition used in {MMM95} and basically due to Kronecker for solving zero-dimensional systems: A system is solved if each root is represented in such way as to allow the performance of any arithmetical operations over the arithmetical expressions of its coordinates. We propose new definitions for solving zero-dimensional systems in this sense by introducing the Univariate Representation of their roots. We show by this way that the solutions of any zero-dimensional system of polynomials can be expressed through a special kind of univariate representation (Rational Univariate Representation): where (f,g,g 1, …,g n ) are polynomials of {K[X} 1, …, X n ]. A special feature of our Rational Univariate Representation is that we dont loose geometrical information contained in the initial system. Moreover we propose different efficient algorithms for the computation of the Rational Univariate Representation, and we make a comparison with standard known tools.},

The book is written for nonspecialists and for readers with a diverse range of backgrounds. It assumes knowledge of the material covered in a standard undergraduate course in abstract algebra, and it would help to have some previous exposure to Gr\"{o}bner bases. The book does not assume the reader is familiar with more advanced concepts such as modules. For this new edition the authors added two new sections and a new chapter, updated the references and made numerous minor improvements throughout the text.},

@book{cox+little+oshea,
    abstract = {Algebraic Geometry is the study of systems of polynomial equations in one or more variables, asking such questions as: Does the system have finitely many solutions, and if so how can one find them? And if there are infinitely many solutions, how can they be described and manipulated? The solutions of a system of polynomial equations form a geometric object called a variety; the corresponding algebraic object is an ideal. There is a close relationship between ideals and varieties which reveals the intimate link between algebra and geometry. Written at a level appropriate to undergraduates, this book covers such topics as the Hilbert Basis Theorem, the Nullstellensatz, invariant theory, projective geometry, and dimension theory. The algorithms to answer questions such as those posed above are an important part of algebraic geometry. This book bases its discussion of algorithms on a generalization of the division algorithm for polynomials in one variable that was only discovered in the 1960's. Although the algorithmic roots of algebraic geometry are old, the computational aspects were neglected earlier in this century. This has changed in recent years, and new algorithms, coupled with the power of fast computers, have let to some interesting applications, for example in robotics and in geometric theorem proving. In preparing a new edition of Ideals, Varieties and Algorithms the authors present an improved proof of the Buchberger Criterion as well as a proof of Bezout's Theorem. Appendix C contains a new section on Axiom and an update about Maple , Mathematica and {REDUCE}.},

Next comes a treatment of elliptic curves over function fields and elliptic surfaces, including specialization theorems for heights and sections. This material serves as a prelude to the theory of minimal models and N\'{e}ron models of elliptic curves, with a discussion of special fibers, conductors, and Ogg's formula. Next comes a brief description of q-models for elliptic curves over C and R, followed by Tate's theory of q-models for elliptic curves with non-integral j-invariant over p-adic fields.

In this system, a pair (Es, Epb) of elliptic curves over F2161 is constructed with the following properties: (i) the {Gaudry-Hess}-Smart Weil descent attack reduces the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem ({ECDLP}) in {Es(F2161}) to a hyperelliptic curve {DLP} in the Jacobian of a curve of genus 7 or 8, which is computationally feasible, but by far not trivial; (ii) Es is isogenous to Es; (iii) the best attack on the {ECDLP} in {Es(F2161}) is the parallelized Pollard rho method. The curve Es is used just as usual in elliptic curve cryptosystems. The curve Es is submitted to a trusted authority for the purpose of key escrow. The crucial difference from other key escrow scenarios is that the trusted authority has to invest a considerable amount of computation to compromise a user's private key, which makes applications such as widespread wire-tapping impossible.},

@article{montgomery87,
    abstract = {Since 1974, several algorithms have been developed that attempt to factor a large number \$N\$ by doing extensive computations modulo \$N\$ and occasionally taking {GCDs} with \$N\$. These began with Pollard's \$p - 1\$ and Monte Carlo methods. More recently, Williams published a \$p + 1\$ method, and Lenstra discovered an elliptic curve method ({ECM}). We present ways to speed all of these. One improvement uses two tables during the second phases of \$p \pm 1\$ and {ECM}, looking for a match. Polynomial preconditioning lets us search a fixed table of size \$n\$ with \$n/2 + o(n)\$ multiplications. A parametrization of elliptic curves lets Step 1 of {ECM} compute the \$x\$-coordinate of \${nP}\$ from that of \$P\$ in about \$9.3 \log\_2 n\$ multiplications for arbitrary \$P\$.},

This is done for enough small primes \$l\$. <P> In a series of unpublished manuscripts, Atkin providedmany improvements that made this algorithm practical.Atkin used the modular equation \$E\_l(X,Y)\$ of \$X\_0(l)\$. The decomposition of thepolynomial \$E\_l(X,j)\in {\bold F}\_p[X]\$ provides some information about \$t\bmod l\$ if\$j\$ is the modular invariant of the elliptic curve.Atkin developed efficient techniquesfor computing nice modular equations (nicer than \$E\_l(X,Y)\$)and was able to efficiently implementthe resulting algorithm.<P> Further improvements were proposed by the author. He showed that for one \$l\$ over two (namely when the Frobeniusaction on the \$l\$-torsion splits) there is a much faster wayto compute the residue modulo \$l\$ of the trace \$t\$.<P> A nice survey paper on these questions is that of Schoof\ref[J.

The method requires O(n) storage space in addition to that needed for the matrix A. 1 Introduction  The known complexity estimates of the computation of the characteristic polynomial and a fortiori, of the Frobenius normal form of special { sparse or black box { square matrices A over a eld F, seem to not be satisfactory. We refer to Kaltofen [8, Open Problem 3] and to Pan et al. [16, 15] for discussions on this subject and survey of current solutions. We denote by M(n) the number of operations in F required for nn matrix multiplications. The characteristic polynomial of a general matrix A can be computed at cost of O(n  3  ) or O(M(n) log...}}},

The lectures were originally given from notes and the paper was written after the course was finished. In spite of this, and only partly because of the shortage of time, the paper still retains many of the shortcomings of a lecture course. The chief of these are an uncertainty of aim—it is never quite clear what sort of audience there will be for such lectures—and an associated switching from formal to informal modes of presentation which may well be less acceptable in print than it is natural in the lecture room. For these (and other) faults, I apologise to the reader.},

    abstract = {Given an error-correcting code of block length n and an arbitrary input string also of length n, the list decoding problem is that of finding all codewords within a specified Hamming distance from the input string. We present an improved list decoding algorithm for decoding Reed-Solomon codes. The list decoding problem for Reed-Solomon codes reduces to the following ``curve-fitting'' problem over a field F: Given n points (x[i].y[i]), 1 <= i <= n (where x[i],y[i] are elements of the field F), a degree parameter k and error parameter e, find all univariate polynomials P over the field F of degree at most k such that y[i]=P(x[i]) for all but at most e values of i in the range 1 <= i <= n. We give an algorithm that solves this problem for e < n - sqrt{kn}, which improves over the previous best result due to Sudan [Journal of Complexity, Vol. 13, 1997], for every choice of k and n. Of particular interest is the case of k/n > 1/3, where the result yields the first asymptotic improvement since Peterson's original algorithm nearly four decades ago.The algorithm generalizes to solve the list decoding problem for other algebraic codes, specifically alternant codes (a class of codes including BCH codes) and algebraic-geometric codes. In both cases, we obtain a list decoding algorithm that corrects up to n - sqrt{n(n-d')} errors, where n is the block length and d' is the designed distance of the code. The improvement for the case of algebraic-geometric codes extends the methods of Shokrollahi and Wasserman [STOC '98] and improves upon their bound for every choice of n and d'. We also present some other consequences of our algorithm including a solution to a weighted curve fitting problem, which is of use in soft-decision decoding algorithms for Reed-Solomon codes.},

    abstract = {For every 0 \&lt; R \&lt; 1 and \&\#949; \&gt; 0, we present an explicit construction of error-correcting codes of rate R that can be list decoded in polynomial time up to a fraction ({1-R}-\&\#949;) of errors. These codes achieve the "capacity" for decoding from  adversarial  errors, i.e., achieve the  optimal  trade-off between rate and error-correction radius. At least theoretically, this meets one of the central challenges in coding {theory.Prior} to this work, explicit codes achieving capacity were not known for  any  rate R. In fact, our codes are the first to beat the error-correction radius of {1-\&\#8730;R}, that was achieved for {Reed-Solomon} ({RS}) codes in [9], for all rates R. (For rates R \&lt; 1/16, Parvaresh and Vardy [12] had recently improved upon the {1-\&\#8730;R} bound; for R \&\#8594; 0, their algorithm can decode a fraction {1-O}(R {log(1/R})) of {errors.)Our} codes are simple to describe -- they are certain  folded {Reed-Solomon} codes , which are in fact  exactly  {RS} codes, but viewed as a code over a larger alphabet by careful bundling of codeword symbols. Given the ubiquity of {RS} codes, this is an appealing feature of our result, since the codes we propose are not too far from the ones in actual {use.The} main insight in our work is that some carefully chosen folded {RS} codes are "compressed" versions of a related family of {Parvaresh-Vardy} codes. Further, the decoding of the folded {RS} codes can be reduced to list decoding the related {Parvaresh-Vardy} codes. The alphabet size of these folded {RS} codes is polynomial in the block length. This can be reduced to a constant that depends on the distance \&\#949; to capacity using ideas concerning "list recovering" and expander-based codes from [7, 8]. Concatenating the folded {RS} codes with suitable inner codes also gives us polytime constructible binary codes that can be efficiently list decoded up to the Zyablov bound.},

Engineers define the  ” Fast Fourier Transform” as a method of solving the interpolation problem where the coefficient ring used to construct the polynomials has a special multiplicative structure. Mathematicians define the  ” Fast Fourier Transform” as a method of solving the evaluation problem. One purpose of the document is to provide a mathematical treatment of the topic of the  ” Fast Fourier Transform” that can also be understood by someone who has an understanding of the topic from the engineering perspective.},

By a suitable extension of fast univariate Euclidean division, we obtain theoretical and practical improvements over a direct recursive approach; for a family of special cases, we reach quasi-linear complexity. The main outcome we have in mind is the acceleration of higher-level algorithms, by interfacing our low-level implementation with languages such as {AXIOM} or Maple We show the potential for huge speed-ups, by comparing two {AXIOM} implementations of van Hoeij and Monagan's modular {GCD} algorithm.},

If this extension is Galois with a solvable automorphism group, then the equation  {f(X})  = 0 can be solved by radicals. The first step of the solution consists of splitting the extension  {M/K}  into intermediate fields. Such computations are classical, and we explain how fast polynomial arithmetic can be used to speed up the process. Moreover, we extend the algorithms to a more general case of extensions that are no longer Galois. Numerical examples are provided, including results obtained with our implementation for Hilbert class fields of imaginary quadratic fields.},

As an application, we obtain a randomized algorithm for factoring degree n polynomials over F\_q requiring (n^{1.5 + o(1)} + n^{1 + o(1)}log q)log^{1 + o(1)}q bit operations, improving upon the methods of von zur Gathen \& Shoup (1992) and Kaltofen \& Shoup (1998). Our results also imply algorithms for irreducibility testing and computing minimal polynomials whose running times are best-possible, up to lower order terms.As in Umans (2008), we reduce modular composition to certain instances of multipoint evaluation of multivariate polynomials. We then give an algorithm that solves this problem optimally (up to lower order terms), in arbitrary characteristic. The main idea is to lift to characteristic 0, apply a small number of rounds of multimodular reduction, and finish with a small number of multidimensional FFTs. The final evaluations are then reconstructed using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. As a bonus, we obtain a very efficient data structure supporting polynomial evaluation queries, which is of independent interest.Our algorithm uses techniques which are commonly employed in practice, so it may be competitive for real problem sizes. This contrasts with previous asymptotically fast methods relying on fast matrix multiplication.},

    abstract = {The success of the symbolic mathematical computation discipline is striking. The theoretical advances have been continuous and significant: Gr\"{o}bner bases, the Risch integration algorithm, integer lattice basis reduction, hypergeometric summation algorithms, etc. From the beginning in the early 1960s, it has been the tradition of our discipline to create software that makes our ideas readily available to scientists, engineers, and educators: {SAC}-1, Reduce, Macsyma, etc. The commercial viability of our system products is proven by Maple and Mathematica. Today's user communities of symbolic computation systems are diverse: educators, engineers, stock market analysts, etc. The mathematics and computer science in the design and implementation of our algorithms are sophisticated. The research challenges in symbolic computation at the close of the twentieth century are formidable. I state my favorite eight open problems in symbolic computation. They range from problems in symbolic/numeric computing, symbolic algorithm synthesis, to system component construction. I have worked on seven of my problems and borrowed one from George Collins. I present background to each of my problems and a clear-cut test that evaluates whether a proposed attack has solved one of my problems. An additional ninth open problem by Rob Corless and David Jeffrey on complex function semantics is given in an appendix.},

@article{vdHoven02,
    abstract = {Assume that we wish to expand the product  h = fg  of two formal power series  f  and  g . Classically, there are two types of algorithms to do this:  zealous  algorithms first expand  f  and  g  up to order  n , multiply the results and truncate at order  n .  Lazy  algorithms on the contrary compute the coefficients of  f, g  and  h  gradually and they perform no more computations than strictly necessary at each stage. In particular, at the moment we compute the coefficient  h i  of  z i  in  h , only  f 0 ,...,  f i  and  g 0 ,...,  g i  are {known.Lazy} algorithms have the advantage that the coefficients of  f  and  g  may actually depend on "previous" coefficients of  h , as long as they are computed before they are needed in the multiplication, i.e. the coefficients  f i  and  g i  may depend on  h 0 ,...,  h i -1 . For this reason, lazy algorithms are extremely useful when solving functional equations in rings of formal power series. However, lazy algorithms have the disadvantage that the classical asymptotically fast multiplication algorithms on polynomials-such as the divide and conquer algorithm and fast Fourier multiplication-cannot be {used.In} a previous paper, we therefore introduced  relaxed  algorithms, which share the property concerning the resolution of functional equations with lazy algorithms, but perform slightly more computations than lazy algorithms during the computation of a given coefficient of  h . These extra computations anticipate the computations of the next coefficients of  h  and dramatically improve the asymptotic time complexities of such {algorithms.In} this paper, we survey several classical and new zealous algorithms for manipulating formal power series, including algorithms for multiplication, division, resolution of differential equations, composition and reversion. Next, we give various relaxed algorithms for these operations. All algorithms are specified in great detail and we prove theoretical time and space complexity bounds. Most algorithms have been experimentally implemented in C++ and we provide benchmarks. We conclude by some suggestions for future developments and a discussion of the fitness of the lazy and relaxed approaches for specific {applications.This} paper is intended both for those who are interested in the most recent algorithms for the manipulation of formal power series and for those who want to actually implement a power series library into a computer algebra system.},

@incollection{backus:turing+lecture,
    abstract = {Conventional programming languages are growing ever more enormous, but not stronger. Inherent defects at the most basic level cause them to be both fat and weak: their primitive word-at-a-time style of programming inherited from their common ancestor-the yon Neumann computer, their close coupling of semantics to state transitions, their division of programming into a world of expressions and a world of statements, their inability to effectively use powerful combining forms for building new programs from existing ones, and their lack of useful mathematical properties for reasoning about programs. An alternative functional style of programming is founded on the use of combining forms for creating programs. Functional programs deal with structured data, are often nonrepetitive and nonrecursive, are hierarchically constructed, do not name their arguments, and do not require the complex machinery of procedure declarations to become generally applicable. Combining forms can use high-level programs to build still higher level ones in a style not possible in conventional languages. Associated with the functional style of programming is an algebra of programs whose variables range over programs and whose operations are combining forms. This algebra can be used to transform programs and to solve equations whose "unknowns" are programs in much the same way one tranforms equations in high school algebra. These transformations are given by algebraic laws and are carried out in the same language in which programs are written. Combining forms are chosen not only for their programming power but also the power of their associated algebraic laws. General theorems of the algebra give the detailed behavior and termination conditions for large classes of programs. A new class of computing systems uses the functional programming style both in its programming language and in its stage transition rules. Unlike von Neumann languages, these systems have semantics loosely coupled to states -- only one state transition occurs per major computation.},

    abstract = {Arrows are a popular form of abstract computation. Being more general than monads, they are more broadly applicable, and in particular are a good abstraction for signal processing and dataflow computations. Most notably, arrows form the basis for a domain specific language called Yampa, which has been used in a variety of concrete applications, including animation, robotics, sound synthesis, control systems, and graphical user interfaces. Our primary interest is in better understanding the class of abstract computations captured by Yampa. Unfortunately, arrows are not concrete enough to do this with precision. To remedy this situation we introduce the concept of commutative arrows that capture a kind of non-interference property of concurrent computations. We also add an init operator, and identify a crucial law that captures the causal nature of arrow effects. We call the resulting computational model causal commutative arrows. To study this class of computations in more detail, we define an extension to the simply typed lambda calculus called causal commutative arrows ({CCA}), and study its properties. Our key contribution is the identification of a normal form for {CCA} called causal commutative normal form ({CCNF}). By defining a normalization procedure we have developed an optimization strategy that yields dramatic improvements in performance over conventional implementations of arrows. We have implemented this technique in Haskell, and conducted benchmarks that validate the effectiveness of our approach. When combined with stream fusion, the overall methodology can result in speed-ups of greater than two orders of magnitude.},

Moreover, the monadic programming style provides a convenient syntax for many kinds of computation, so that each library defines a new sublanguage. Recently, several workers have proposed a generalization of monads, called variously  ” arrows ” or Freyd-categories. The extra generality promises to increase the power, expressiveness and efficiency of the embedded approach, but does not mesh as well with the native abstraction and application. Definitions are typically given in a point-free style, which is useful for proving general properties, but can be awkward for programming specific instances. In this paper we define a simple extension to the functional language Haskell that makes these new notions of computation more convenient to use. Our language is similar to the monadic style, and has similar reasoning properties. Moreover, it is extensible, in the sense that new combining forms can be defined as expressions in the host language. 1.},

The advantage of the use of bi-arrows for invertible programming is the preservation of invertibility properties using the biarrow combinators.

Besides bidirectional polytypic examples, including invertible serialization, we give the definition of a monadic bi-arrow transformer, which we use to construct a bidirectional parser/pretty printer.},

Starting from the foundations, this book illuminates the concepts of category, functor, natural transformation, and duality.  The book then turns to adjoint functors, which provide a description of universal constructions, an analysis of the representations of functors by sets of morphisms, and a means of manipulating direct and inverse limits.  These categorical concepts are extensively illustrated in the remaining chapters, which include many applications of the basic existence theorem for adjoint functors.  The categories of algebraic systems are constructed from certain adjoint-like data and characterized by Beck's theorem.  After considering a variety of applications, the book continues with the construction and exploitation of Kan extensions.   This second edition includes a number of revisions and additions, including two new chapters on topics of active interest.  One is on symmetric monoidal categories and braided monoidal categories and the coherence theorems for them.  The second describes 2-categories and the higher dimensional categories which have recently come into prominence.

    abstract = {Genus 2 curves are useful in cryptography for both discrete-log based and
pairing-based systems, but a method is required to compute genus 2 curves such
that the Jacobian has a given number of points. Currently, all known methods
involve constructing genus 2 curves with complex multiplication via computing
their three Igusa class polynomials. These polynomials have rational
coefficients and require extensive computation and precision to compute. Both
the computation and the complexity analysis of these algorithms can be improved
by a more precise understanding of the denominators of the coefficients of the
polynomials. The main goal of this paper is to give a bound on the denominators
of Igusa class polynomials of genus 2 curves with {CM} by a primitive quartic {CM}
field. We give an overview of Igusa's results on the moduli space of genus two
curves and the method to construct genus 2 curves via their Igusa invariants.
We also give a complete characterization of the reduction type of a {CM} abelian
surface, for biquadratic, cyclic, and {non-Galois} quartic {CM} fields, and for any
type of prime decomposition of the prime, including ramified primes. The
methods of the proof of the main result involve studying the embedding problem
of the quartic {CM} field into certain matrix algebras over quaternions and
invoking techniques from crystalline deformation theory.},

    abstract = {Key predistribution schemes ({KPSs}) and one-time broadcast encryption schemes ({OTBESs}) are unconditionally secure protocols for key distribution in networks. The efficiency of these schemes has been measured in previous works in terms of their information rate, that is, the ratio between the length of the secret keys and the length of the secret information that must be stored by every user. Several constructions with optimal information rate have been proposed, but in them the secret keys are taken from a finite field with at least as many elements as the number of users in the network. This can be an important drawback in very large networks in which the nodes have limited computational resources as, for instance, wireless sensor networks. Actually, key predistribution schemes have been applied recently in the design of key distribution protocols for such networks.  In this paper we present a method to construct key predistribution schemes from linear codes that provide new families of {KPSs} and {OTBESs} for an arbitrarily large number of users and with secret keys of constant size. As a consequence of the {Gilbert-Varshamov} bound, we can prove that our {KPSs} are asymptotically more efficient than previous constructions, specially if we consider {KPSs} that are secure against coalitions formed by a constant fraction of the users. We analyze as well the {KPSs} that are obtained from families of algebraic geometry linear codes that are above the {Gilbert-Varshamov} bound, as the ones constructed from the curves of Garcia and Stichtenoth. Finally, we discuss how the use of {KPSs} based on algebraic geometry codes can provide more efficient {OTBESs}.},

    abstract = {Secure computation consists of protocols for secure arithmetic: secret values are added and multiplied securely by networked processors. The striking feature of secure computation is that security is maintained even in the presence of an adversary who corrupts a quorum of the processors and who exercises full, malicious control over them. One of the fundamental primitives at the heart of secure computation is secret-sharing. Typically, the required secret-sharing techniques build on Shamir's scheme, which can be viewed as a cryptographic twist on the {Reed-Solomon} error correcting code. In this work we further the connections between secure computation and error correcting codes. We demonstrate that threshold secure computation in the secure channels model can be based on arbitrary codes. For a network of size n, we then show a reduction in communication for secure computation amounting to a multiplicative logarithmic factor (in n) compared to classical methods for small, e.g., constant size fields, while tolerating  players to be corrupted, where ε\&gt; 0 can be arbitrarily small. For large networks this implies considerable savings in communication. Our results hold in the broadcast/negligible error model of Rabin and {Ben-Or}, and complement results from {CRYPTO} 2006 for the zero-error model of {Ben-Or}, Goldwasser and Wigderson ({BGW}). Our general theory can be extended so as to encompass those results from {CRYPTO} 2006 as well. We also present a new method for constructing high information rate ramp schemes based on arbitrary codes, and in particular we give a new construction based on algebraic geometry codes.},

    abstract = {This work deals with  {MPC}-friendly  linear secret sharing schemes ({LSSS}), a mathematical primitive upon which secure multi-party computation ({MPC}) can be based and which was introduced by Cramer, Damgaard and Maurer ({EUROCRYPT} 2000). Chen and Cramer proposed a special class of such schemes that is constructed from algebraic geometry and that enables efficient secure multi-party computation over fixed finite fields ({CRYPTO} 2006). We extend this in four ways. First, we propose an abstract coding-theoretic framework in which this class of schemes and its (asymptotic) properties can be cast and analyzed. Second, we show that for every finite field , there exists an infinite family of {LSSS} over  that is asymptotically good in the following sense: the schemes are  ideal,  i.e., each share consists of a single -element, and the schemes have t-strong multiplication on n players, where the corruption tolerance  tends to a constant ν(q) with 0 \&lt; ν(q) \&lt; 1 when n tends to infinity. Moreover, when  tends to infinity, ν(q) tends to 1, which is optimal. This leads to explicit lower bounds on , our measure of asymptotic optimal corruption tolerance. We achieve this by combining the results of Chen and Cramer with a dedicated field-descent method. In particular, in the -case there exists a family of binary t-strongly multiplicative ideal {LSSS} with  when n tends to infinity, a one-bit secret and just a one-bit share for every player. Previously, such results were shown for  with q ≥ 49 a square. Third, we present an infinite family of ideal schemes with t-strong multiplication that does not rely on algebraic geometry and that works over every finite field . Its corruption tolerance vanishes, yet still . Fourth and finally, we give an improved non-asymptotic upper bound on corruption tolerance.},
